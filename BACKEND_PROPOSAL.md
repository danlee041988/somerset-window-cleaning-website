const encryptedData = {
  name: encrypt(customer.name, process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY),
  email: encrypt(customer.email, process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY),
  phone: encrypt(customer.phone, process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY),
  address: encrypt(customer.address, process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY),
  // Postcode stored separately for scheduling (less sensitive)
  postcodeArea: customer.postcode.substring(0, 4)
};
```

### **Access Logging**
```javascript
// Audit trail for data access
const auditLog = {
  userId: req.user.id,
  action: 'VIEW_CUSTOMER',
  resourceId: customer.id,
  timestamp: new Date(),
  ipAddress: req.ip,
  userAgent: req.get('user-agent'),
  success: true
};
```

### **GDPR Compliance**
- **Right to access**: Customers can download their data
- **Right to rectification**: Easy data updates
- **Right to erasure**: Complete data deletion
- **Data portability**: Export data in standard format
- **Consent management**: Track and manage permissions

   - Regular data exports
   - Clear deletion procedures
   - Full audit access

## Next Steps

1. **Security consultation** - Discuss specific concerns
2. **Proof of concept** - Build minimal viable system
3. **Security audit** - Independent review before launch
4. **Gradual migration** - Start with non-sensitive data
5. **Staff training** - Ensure team understands security
