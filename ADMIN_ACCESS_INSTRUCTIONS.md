## 📱 Admin Dashboard Access

### **Primary URL** (Use this one):
🔗 **https://window-cleaning-booking-system-admin.vercel.app/**

### **Login Credentials**:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`

---

## 🚨 Important Notes:

1. **Use the correct URL** - The admin dashboard is hosted at:
   - ✅ `window-cleaning-booking-system-admin.vercel.app`
   - ❌ NOT `somerset-admin-dashboard-xxx.vercel.app` (old preview URL)

2. **Clear your browser cache** if you still have issues:
   - Press `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
   - Or open in an incognito/private window

3. **The system is now working** - I've tested it and confirmed:
   - ✅ API is accepting connections
   - ✅ CORS is properly configured
   - ✅ Login credentials are valid
   - ✅ Bookings are visible in the dashboard

## 🆘 If You Still Can't Login:

1. **Verify the URL** - Must be exactly: https://window-cleaning-booking-system-admin.vercel.app/
