    subtitle="Answers about our professional window cleaning service"
    items={[
      {
        title: 'What cleaning frequency do you recommend?',
        description: 'Most residential customers choose 4-weekly cleaning for consistently spotless windows. Properties in quieter areas often do well with 8-weekly service. We\'ll recommend the best schedule based on your location and preferences.',

        title: 'Why pure water instead of detergents?',
