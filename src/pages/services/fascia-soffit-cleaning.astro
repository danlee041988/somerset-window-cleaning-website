        title: 'What exactly are fascias and soffits anyway?',
        description: 'Great question! Look up at your roofline - fascias are the vertical boards behind your gutters, soffits are underneath. When they\'re green and grimy, your whole house looks tired. When they\'re clean, your home looks loved and valuable!',
