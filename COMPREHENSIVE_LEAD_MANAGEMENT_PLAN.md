# 🎯 Comprehensive Lead Management System Plan

## 🔍 **Current Situation Analysis**

### **Customer Journey Scenarios:**
1. **Online Booking Form** → Auto-priced or needs custom quote
2. **Phone Calls** → Manual entry, often needs site visit  
3. **General Enquiry** → Vague request, needs qualification
4. **Physical Quotation** → Large/complex properties, access issues
5. **Customer Thinking** → Quote provided but customer undecided

### **Current Gaps:**
- No month-by-month analytics
- No clear active vs completed separation  
- Limited follow-up management
- No site visit scheduling
- No quote versioning/tracking

- 💰 **Quote Sent** - Quote provided to customer
- ⏰ **Follow-up Required** - Customer thinking, needs gentle nudging
- 🔄 **Follow-up Overdue** - No response, urgent action needed

#### **Completed Statuses (Archive):**
- ✅ **Accepted → Squeegee** - Quote accepted, transferred to Squeegee
- ❌ **Rejected** - Customer declined quote
- 😶 **No Response** - Customer went silent after follow-ups
- 🚫 **Not Viable** - Cannot provide service (access, location, etc.)
