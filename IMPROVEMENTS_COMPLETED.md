- Monitor rate limiting logs for potential abuse
- Regular security audits recommended

- **Improved Security**: IP tracking and server-side validation
- **Better Performance**: Memoized calculations reduce CPU usage
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant components for all users
- **Mobile Friendly**: Optimized for touch devices
- **Maintainable**: Better code organization and test coverage
