# Simple Improvements for Somerset Window Cleaning

Focus: Help customers find you and book quotes easily.

## 1. Better Service Discovery

### Add Simple Service Comparisons
```typescript
// On services page - help customers choose
const serviceHelper = {
  "Not sure which service?": {
    "Streaky windows": "Window Cleaning - our main service",
    "Overflowing gutters": "Gutter Cleaning - prevent damage", 
    "Dirty solar panels": "Solar Panel Cleaning - restore efficiency",
    "Green conservatory": "Conservatory Cleaning - full restoration"
  }
}
```

## 2. Instant Quote Estimates

### Add Price Ranges to Form
```typescript
// Show estimate as they fill form
const priceEstimates = {
  "window-cleaning": {
    "terraced": "£15-25",
    "semi-detached": "£25-35",
    "detached": "£35-45"
  },
  "gutter-cleaning": {
    "terraced": "£60-80",
    "semi-detached": "£80-100",
    "detached": "£100-150"
  }
}

// Display: "Typical price for your property: £25-35"
```

## 3. Trust Building

### Add Recent Bookings Widget
```typescript
// Show (anonymized) recent activity
const RecentActivity = () => {
  // From Supabase, last 5 bookings
  return (
    <div class="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded">
      <p>🎉 John from Bath just booked gutter cleaning</p>
      <p>✅ Sarah from Bristol booked monthly window cleaning</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## 4. Reduce Booking Friction

### One-Click Rebooking
```typescript
// In confirmation email
"Happy with our service? Book your next clean:"
[Book Same Service Again] // Pre-fills everything
```

### Smart Postcode Validation
```typescript
// Instant feedback
const checkPostcode = (postcode) => {
  const prefix = postcode.substring(0, 3).toUpperCase();
  
  if (COVERED_AREAS.includes(prefix)) {
    return { valid: true, message: "✅ Yes, we cover your area!" }
  } else if (NEARBY_AREAS.includes(prefix)) {
    return { valid: true, message: "📍 We cover your area with small travel charge" }
  } else {
    return { valid: false, message: "Sorry, we don't cover this area yet" }
  }
}
```

## 5. Simple Analytics That Matter

### Track What Converts
```sql
-- Add to kb_items queries
UPDATE kb_items 
SET usage_count = usage_count + 1,
    last_viewed = NOW()
WHERE slug = ?;

-- Weekly email: "Window cleaning price" was viewed 47 times
```

### Booking Funnel
```typescript
// Track where people drop off
const trackBookingStep = (step: string) => {
  // 'viewed_form', 'started_filling', 'submitted'
  supabase.from('analytics_events').insert({
    event: 'booking_funnel',
    step,
    timestamp: new Date()
  });
}
```
