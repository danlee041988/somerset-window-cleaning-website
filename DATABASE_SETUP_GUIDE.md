```

### Step 2: Manual Verification in Dashboard

1. **Check Tables**
   - Go to "Table Editor" in Supabase dashboard
   - Verify all tables exist: customers, services, service_areas, bookings, etc.

2. **Check Sample Data**
   - Open the `services` table - should show 6 services
   - Open the `service_areas` table - should show 5 areas
   - Verify data looks correct

3. **Test Views**
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Run: `SELECT * FROM customer_lifetime_value LIMIT 5;`
   - Run: `SELECT * FROM monthly_revenue_dashboard LIMIT 5;`

### Step 3: Test Website Integration

1. **Test Booking Form**
   - Go to your website's booking page
   - Fill out and submit a test booking
   - Check if it appears in the `bookings` table

2. **Check Real-time Features**
   - Monitor the dashboard while submitting bookings
   - Verify real-time updates are working

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**
   - Ensure you're using an admin account
   - Check that you have the correct project selected

2. **PostGIS Extension Errors**
   - PostGIS should be available in Supabase by default
   - If errors occur, the schema will skip geographic features

3. **ENUM Type Errors**
   - The corrected schema moves ENUM definitions to the top
   - If you see ENUM errors, ensure you're using the corrected schema

4. **Connection Issues**
   - Verify your project URL is correct
   - Check that your anon key is valid

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Supabase dashboard logs
2. Run the verification script to identify specific problems
3. Review the SQL execution output for error messages

## Post-Setup Configuration

### Row Level Security (RLS)
